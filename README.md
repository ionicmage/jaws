## Installation

Option 1: Download the repo with Git 

```git clone https://github.com/ionicmage/jaws.git```

then find jaws in your library and run the .py from there

Make sure to reference ```requirements.txt``` and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to access the full script

Option 2: Download just the script and run it in your editor of choice

----

## Usage

The code is pretty much standalone, requiring little user input to function. Give it a valid URL to scrape, tell it what to download, and give it a path to save it to, and let it work.

Note that it will download EVERYTHING if you let it, so use at your own discretion


```url``` - the url to scrape. 

```url -o``` - the flag o for only, download *only* what you tell it to from the url. (html or css as of first release)

```location``` - where to download files to. i recommend CDing to the repo and creating a folder there first. Or create a folder if you downloaded the script on its own.
